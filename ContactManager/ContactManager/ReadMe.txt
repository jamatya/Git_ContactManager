How to use an ASP.NET MVC Design Template
=========================================

To use this Template, simply copy the template files to your project. 

After you download and decompress a Design Template, you'll see one or more of the following folders:

  * DesignTemplate -- Contains design content that can be used with either a C# or Visual Basic .NET ASP.NET MVC project.

  * DesignTemplateCS -- Contains design content that can be used with a C# ASP.NET MVC project.

  * DesignTemplateVB -- Contains design content that can be used with a Visual Basic .NET project.

Copy each file from the appropriate DesignTemplate folder to your ASP.NET MVC project. For example, if the DesignTemplate folder contains a file with the path DesignTemplate\Content\Site.css then you need to copy this file to the exact same location in your ASP.NET MVC application. A Design Template can include Cascading Style Sheets, View Master Pages, View User Controls, JavaScript, custom HTML Helpers, and other types of files.

In many cases, you need to overwrite an existing file when copying a file from a Design Template to an ASP.NET MVC project. For example, you almost always need to overwrite the Site.css file. Ensure that you back up all files in an existing ASP.NET MVC application before overwriting the files.
